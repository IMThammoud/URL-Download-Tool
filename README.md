# URL-Download-Tool
Download videos from URLs

This project is supposed to run on Linux x86 servers.

For local testing purposes there is a Windows binary too.

# To Do List:

* Find a way to give the downloaded video an unique name for each Request (ServerSide).
* Let the App handle concurrent Requests so Requests do not interrupt each other.
* Add options to select MP3 or MP4 Download (Or more).
* Build a juicy Front-End for that sweet Eye-Candy.
* Define the location of yt-dlp Binary INSIDE of the compiled .Jar File so only the .Jar File has to be deployed as a single File.
